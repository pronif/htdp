# HTDP
## What?
[How to Design Programs](https://www.htdp.org).

[HTDP](https://www.htdp.org) is an introductory CS course focused on program design. It uses the Racket language, which is a Lisp dialect.

## Why?
After reading more than a milion times on HackerNews how Lisp is better at this and that, I decided to try it first hand.

## Use
Download Racket from the [download page](https://racket-lang.org/download/) and load on the included IDE DrRacket.
